TRINITY WALLET - WINDOWS EXECUTABLE BUILD INFORMATION
=======================================================================

STATUS: Automated Build System Configured ✓

The Windows executable (TrinityWallet.exe) is automatically built using
GitHub Actions whenever changes are made to the wallet code.

ULTRA-FAST BUILD SYSTEM:
-------------------------
We've configured an optimized build environment with:

1. PyInstaller with optimized settings
2. Clean build process (removes cache between builds)
3. UPX compression for smaller file size
4. Single-file executable output
5. Windowed mode (no console) for professional appearance

BUILD SCRIPT:
-------------
Location: trinity_wallet_py/build_windows_fast.py

This Python script:
- Checks and installs dependencies automatically
- Cleans previous builds for faster compilation
- Uses optimized PyInstaller settings
- Produces a single .exe file ready to distribute
- Copies output to Files/ folder automatically

GITHUB ACTIONS WORKFLOWS:
--------------------------
Two workflows are configured:

1. build-wallet.yml
   - Builds executables for Windows, Linux, and macOS
   - Uploads as GitHub Actions artifacts
   - Runs on every push to trinity_wallet_py/

2. build-and-commit-exe.yml  
   - Builds Windows .exe and commits to Files/ folder
   - Runs on manual trigger or code changes
   - Automatically updates the repository

HOW TO BUILD MANUALLY:
-----------------------

On Windows:
-----------
cd trinity_wallet_py
python build_windows_fast.py

The .exe will be created in ../Files/TrinityWallet.exe

On Linux (requires Wine for Windows .exe):
-------------------------------------------
# Install Wine and Windows Python first (see BUILD.md)
cd trinity_wallet_py
python3 build_windows_fast.py

BUILD TIME:
-----------
Typical build time: 30-90 seconds on modern hardware
- Initial build: ~90 seconds (downloads dependencies)
- Subsequent builds: ~30 seconds (dependencies cached)

OUTPUT:
-------
- File: TrinityWallet.exe
- Size: ~10-15 MB (includes Python runtime and all dependencies)
- Type: Single-file Windows executable
- Requirements: Windows 7 or later (64-bit)

AUTOMATIC BUILDS:
-----------------
Windows .exe is automatically built by GitHub Actions and will be
available in this Files/ folder after the workflow completes.

To trigger a manual build:
1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "Build and Commit Windows Executable" workflow  
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Wait for completion (~2-3 minutes)
5. The .exe will be committed to this folder

VERIFICATION:
-------------
All builds are performed in GitHub's secure build environment.
You can verify builds by:
- Checking workflow logs in the Actions tab
- Building from source yourself using the build script
- Comparing checksums with workflow artifacts
