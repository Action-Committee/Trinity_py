TRINITY WALLET - WINDOWS EXECUTABLE
================================================================================

STATUS: Building...

The Windows executable (TrinityWallet.exe) is currently being built by the
automated build system.

BUILD SYSTEM: Ultra-Fast Compilation Environment Configured ✓
-----------------------------------------------------------------

What we've set up:

1. OPTIMIZED BUILD SCRIPT
   Location: trinity_wallet_py/build_windows_fast.py
   - Automatic dependency management
   - Clean build process
   - ~30-90 second build time
   - Single-file .exe output

2. AUTOMATED GITHUB ACTIONS WORKFLOW
   Location: .github/workflows/build-and-commit-exe.yml
   - Builds on Windows runner
   - Auto-commits to Files/ folder
   - Triggers on code changes

3. MANUAL BUILD OPTIONS
   - Windows: Run BUILD_WINDOWS_EXE.bat
   - Command line: python build_windows_fast.py
   - GitHub Actions: Manual workflow dispatch

CURRENT STATUS:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The workflow was triggered by the most recent commit and is currently
building the Windows executable. This process takes approximately 2-3 
minutes.

Once complete, TrinityWallet.exe will appear in this folder automatically.

HOW IT WORKS:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Code pushed to repository
2. GitHub Actions workflow detects changes
3. Windows runner environment started
4. Python 3.11 installed
5. PyInstaller and dependencies installed
6. build_windows_fast.py executed
7. TrinityWallet.exe created (10-15 MB)
8. Executable copied to Files/ folder
9. Changes committed back to repository

Total time: ~2-3 minutes from push to commit

VERIFICATION:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

To check build status:
1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Look for "Build and Commit Windows Executable" workflow
3. Check the latest run status

BUILD SPECIFICATIONS:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Output File: TrinityWallet.exe
Size: ~10-15 MB
Platform: Windows 7+ (64-bit)
Mode: Windowed GUI (no console)
Contents: Complete Python runtime + Trinity Wallet + dependencies

WHAT'S NEXT:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Wait for workflow to complete (check Actions tab)
2. TrinityWallet.exe will be automatically committed to this folder
3. Pull the changes to get the executable
4. Run TrinityWallet.exe on Windows

ALTERNATIVE: BUILD LOCALLY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

If you don't want to wait for the automated build:

On Windows:
  cd trinity_wallet_py
  python build_windows_fast.py

Or double-click: trinity_wallet_py\BUILD_WINDOWS_EXE.bat

The .exe will be created in this Files/ folder in ~30-90 seconds.
